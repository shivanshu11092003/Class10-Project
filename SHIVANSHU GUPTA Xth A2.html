</td><td><p style="    font-size: 25px;background:#e2feff94"> Garena Free Fire GARENA INTERNATIONAL I PRIVATE LIMITED GARENA FREE FIRE is a free-to-play action shooter in the 'battle royale' tradition -- meaning players are dropped into an arena (in this case, a map of a large island) where they fight to the death until only one player is left standing. Here, 50 players are air-dropped from a plane and parachute down to an island, at first with nothing but the clothes on their back. Once they land, players explore the terrain and the buildings scattered around it, looking for weapons, armor, ammo, and health packs. As time ticks down, a designated 'safe' area continually shrinks (outside this area, the air is toxic), driving players into closer and closer proximity. Combat goes on until either the timer runs out or one player outlives all the rest<br>

 Garena Free Fire is also a “Battle Royale” game.The plot of the game has a story that talked about people from defferent background and classes.They were brought to an isolated island by a misterious organizatio called FF.They were told that only one person can leave this island alive.Some of them were kidnaped by FF, some of them were attracted by bounty game of FF treats everybody as a teaser, hypnotize them, brainwash them and genetic ally modified them.These testers have lost most of their memories and only a few pieces remained.However, these are not important.Ther is only one targerfor all of the- to stay alive.<br>
Your goal is to kill other players. The island has lots of buildings and a rich flora. Buildings contain loot (such as weapons and armor) and flora can be used to hide and ambush other players. At the beginning of the game, nobody has any weapon or armor. Once you hit the ground, you are free to do whatever you want – it is even possible to attack other players with your bare hands. As can be guessed, however, arming yourself with weapons and protecting your body with armor before starting a massacre is a better idea. Let’s do that first, shall we?<br>
The game can offer you a huge variety of characters such as Rafael, who is deadly killer or Laura who is outstanding special agent or Hayato who is legendary Samurai.Moco is outstanding hacker and Misha is extremely talented racer and many others.Also the game can offer you bunch of weapons, such as gatling or katanas.
Its very easy to start playing the game.So by clicking on the “newbie rewards” button. Free Fire awards players free items based on the number of days they log in. Your first reward is a free t-shirt. 24 hours later, you can get a free armor crate too. Check this screen often to collect your rewards. Most of them are cosmetic items and give no advantage to you in terms of gameplay, but you get to look “cooler”.
In addition Free Fire was one of the first battle royale games to hit the mobile market in late 2017, along with three games from NetEase (Survivor Royale, Knives Out, Rules of Survival). Garena soft-launched Free Fire in selected markets across Southeast Asia, a region the studio’s  familiar with, before going worldwide just two-and-a-half months later. Based on player feedback and retention data, Harold Teo and his team felt the game was ready to be on the worldwide stage.
