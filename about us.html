Gameplay<br>																								
Garena Free Fire is an online-only action-adventure battle royale game played in a third person perspective.<br>

<b><i>When the player joins a game, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the play island. While the plane is flying over the island the player can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the player must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the player is to survive on an island with a maximum of 50 -51 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the player encounters along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining.</i></b>

<h2>Reception</h2>
The graphics were described as having "a benefit for mid and low specification phones", but a reviewer stated that "if games with good graphics are your thing then we don't recommend that you play Free Fire Battlegrounds. But if you like battle royale games and want to have fun with your friends, you should definitely play."[10]<br>

Comparing to Rules of Survival (another mobile game of the same genre), Tais Carvalho of TechTudo commented that Free Fire "prioritizes performance, making it a great choice for any type of device. The gameplay stands out and has enough content to entertain and offer rewarding combat." Regarding the progression of characters and skills, she said it is "a flashy add-on."[11]

<b>In the Google Play annual list of "Best Apps of the Year", Free Fire won in the "Best Popular Voted Game" category of 2019, being the most publicly voted in Brazil and in Thailand.[9][12][13]
