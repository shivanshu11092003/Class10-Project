Gameplay<br>
Garena Free Fire is an online-only action-adventure battle royale game played in a third person perspective.<br>

When the player joins a game, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the play island. While the plane is flying over the island the player can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the player must then go looking for weapons and utility items.<br> Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the player is to survive on an island with a maximum of 50 -51 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the player encounters along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining.<br>
